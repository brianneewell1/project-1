project Title: Random MusicBox

project description: music randomizer w/ catagory buttons 

User Story: user is having issues choosing what to listen too, our app will fix that.

wireframe or sketch of the design: our project is made up from three diffrent variables: checklist, the function button, and free music data APIs. 

APIs to be used: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam, https://rapidapi.com/volodimir.kudriachenko/api/iTunes, and https://rapidapi.com/search/spotify

Rough breakdown: WHEN the user selects a catagory, then clicks the randomizer button they will be greeted with a random song.
