Title: Random MusicBox

Project Description: Random music selector. Users are able to select the genre of music they would like to listen to and then our app suggests a random song based on their input.  

User Story: User is having issues choosing what to listen to. Using our app, they select a genre of music they would like to hear and a song is suggested for them.

Wireframe or Sketch of the design: Our project is made up from three different variables: checklist, the function button, and free music data APIs. 

APIs to be used: https://rapidapi.com/volodimir.kudriachenko/api/iTunes, https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search

Rough Breakdown: When the user selects a category, then clicks the randomizer button they will be greeted with a random song.
